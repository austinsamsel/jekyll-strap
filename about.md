![Kate Anderson]![]({{site.baseurl}}//Kate%20retouch2.jpg)


**Kate Anderson** is half of the songwriting team behind the new musical, "Between the Lines" produced by Daryl Roth, based on the book by best-selling author Jodi Picoult and her daughter Samantha Van Leer. Kate and writing partner Elyssa Samsel are the songwriters for the upcoming "Olaf's Frozen Adventure" with Disney Animation that will premiere in 2017. In 2016 Kate and Elyssa were finalists for the Fred Ebb Award.

Kate and Elyssa's work has been featured in the New York Theater Barn's D-Lounge Series, The Platform: London, as well as "4@15" with NYU Steinhardt and UC Irvine. They have penned three short musical comedies, "Camp Wish-No-More", "Llamaze 101", and "My Little Brony". "Camp Wish-No-More", an original musical about a camp for delusional girls who believe they are Disney Princesses, was developed into a full length 90 minute musical, and presented as a staged reading with NYU Steinhardt in the fall of 2013. Kate and Elyssa contributed "Kittens First Full Moon" based on the book by Kevin Henkes to Theatreworks USA's "Fly Guy and Other Stories" which just finished a national tour. Kate and Elyssa are beginning work on two new Animation projects this spring.

Kate's love of theatre began early. By first grade, Kate was writing and performing her own plays with her peers- not much has changed. In 2005, Kate was accepted into Gettysburg College and awarded the Parker B. Wagnild scholarship to pursue music at the Sunderman Conservatory. In 2009, Kate graduated cum laude with a BA in Music, and a minor in Creative Writing. In fall of 2010, Kate was accepted into the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop. Kate was paired with Elyssa Samsel for her very first assignment and the two have been writing partners (and TOTAL BESTIES) ever since. They are both members of the BMI Advanced Workshop and were chosen in 2014 as featured writers for a masterclass with Stephen Schwartz. Kate has studied improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Training Center. She can be seen performing improv around the city with her indie team, Duran Duran Duran. Kate lives in New York with her boyfriend Luke and she would totally have a cat and name it Tutter if her apartment was pet friendly.

**Elyssa Samsel** is the other half of the songwriting team for BETWEEN THE LINES; a new musical produced by Daryl Roth, based on the novel by best-selling novelist Jodi Picoult and Samantha Van Leer. Kate Anderson and Elyssa Samsel are the songwriters for Disney Animation’s “Olaf’s Frozen Adventure,” which will premiere in 2017.  

Their past work includes “Kitten’s First Full Moon,” based on the book by Kevin Henkes, featured in TheatreWorks USA’s “Fly Guy and Other Stories,” which toured the US 2015-2016. They have written three shows for 4@15 under the direction of Brian Blythe; LLAMAZE 101, MY LITTLE BRONY, and CAMP WISH-NO-MORE (which was extended into a full length musical, performed by NYU Steinhardt in the Fall of 2013.)

Elyssa began her classical training on the violin and piano at age six. She currently resides in New York City as a composer, violinist, pianist, singer and actress.  Elyssa is also the songwriter (co-written with Jade Bartlett) of a new musical entitled LIGEIA, based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. In 2010, Elyssa met Kate in their first year of the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop and it was love at first bagel. The two were featured writers in a BMI masterclass with Stephen Schwartz in 2014 with their show BETWEEN THE LINES. Elyssa and Kate are neighbors and enjoy taking long walks together, always stopping by the cat cafe to look for potential "Tutters".
