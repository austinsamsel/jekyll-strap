##Kate Anderson

![Kate Anderson]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/kate-anderson.jpg)

**Kate Anderson's** love of theatre began early. By first grade, Kate was writing and performing her own plays with her peers- not much has changed. Kate is now a performer, lyricist, and librettist surviving in New York City.

In 2005, Kate was accepted into Gettysburg College and awarded the Parker B. Wagnild scholarship to pursue music at the Sunderman Conservatory. In 2009, Kate graduated cum laude with a BA in Music, and a minor in Creative Writing.

In fall of 2010, Kate was accepted into the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop. Kate was paired with Elyssa Samsel for her very first assignment and the two have been writing partners ever since. They are both members of the BMI Advanced Workshop. Kate is also a member of the BMI Librettist Workshop and currently studies improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizen's Brigade Training Center.

Kate and Elyssa's work has been featured in the New York Theater Barn's D-Lounge Series, The Platform: London, as well as "4@15" with NYU Steinhardt and UC Irvine. They have penned three short musical comedies, "Camp Wish-No-More", "Llamaze 101", and "My Little Brony". "Camp Wish-No-More", an original musical about a camp for delusional girls who believe they are Disney Princesses, was developed into a full length 90 minute musical, and presented as a staged reading with NYU Steinhardt in the fall of 2013. Kate and Elyssa contributed "Kittens First Full Moon" based on the book by Kevin Henkes to Theatreworks USA's "Fly Guy and Other Stories" which will tour the US this fall. Kate and Elyssa are currently working on some exciting new projects including two adaptations and an original work.

Currently a composer in the BMI Lehman Engel Advanced Musical Theatre Workshop, Elyssa is working on projects inside and outside of the workshop with fellow member, Kate Anderson. The two of them are currently writing an original Musical Comedy called Camp Wish-No-More, which takes place at a rehabilitation camp for delusional girls who believe themselves to be Disney Princesses or bizarre characters from Fairy Tales. Camp Wish-No-More was recently produced by New York Theatre Barn as part of their monthly series at the D-Lounge in Union Square. Camp Wish-No-More had its first debut as part of the 4@15 UC-Irvine Satellite Program, directed by Brian Blythe.
