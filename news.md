Winter 2017
2016 was an exciting year! In December we were featured in ["The Making of Frozen: A Return to Arendelle"](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/photos/video-making-frozen-return-arendelle-44133721) as it was announced that we are the songwriting team for the Frozen special: "Olaf's Frozen Adventure" premiering this coming holiday season (2017). In August, we participated in New York Stage and Film's Vassar Powerhouse readings series with our show "Between the Lines". Upcoming, we will travel to Atlanta again this January to present some songs for the Junior Theater Festival. Lots of exciting things are brewing. We'll try to include any and all updates here as we have them.

Winter 2016
Wow! Longtime no update, and we have been up to quite a lot! We are working on a brand new musical called "Between the Lines", based on the novel by Jodi Picoult and Samantha Van Leer. We have been working closely with Jodi, Sammy, and book writer Tim McDonald for the past year to adapt this wonderful story into a musical. Recently Jeff Calhoun (Newsies, Grey Gardens, Bonnie and Clyde) came on board as the director. Daryl Roth is producing! We will be presenting some of the music from the show at the Junior Theatre Festival this January in Atlanta, GA! Stay tuned for more updates. 

Additionally, we are working on a very exciting project with a certain Animation studio. An announcement is expected to be made this spring. More on this as we can share it!
